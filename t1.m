% Matlab tutorial, basic variable  manipulation

% What is MATLAB? 
%    Mathworks.com: MATLAB® is a high-level language and interactive
%    environment for numerical computation, visualization, and 
%    programming. Using MATLAB, you can analyze data, develop 
%    algorithms, and create models and applications. 

% What  is a program?
%     Sequence of instructions for the  computer to execute

% For example: 

5 + 5;
5/10
5 - 5


%  we can use 'variables' to store the result, or values of interest

x = 5+ 5  % x has the result, note that whatever is after a '%' isn't executed
                % we call this a comment
                
% if we don't want MATLAB to show the output, we can use ';'
x = 5+2; 
x  % see, x is a new value even though it didn't show up


% there are different types of variables, such as strings
y = 'you can put a string between the single quotes'

% the 'who' command will show the variables 
who
