# MATLAB course

This directory contains several scripts and course materials for a MATLAB course I developed for psychology students at OSU.

The HWs and Lectures sometimes have a (b) at the end of the name because during different iterations of the course I took it a different direction.  Psychology students are more interested in creating experiments then doing heavy data analysis and algorithm development.  Therefore, one iteration focused on developing an experiment with psychtoolbox. Another iteration focused more on general principles of structured programming and using control structures to implement an algorithm.  There was some discussion of optimization and using MATLAB features effectively.

I hope that you find the materials useful.  If you use these, please credit me.
